# Spending-tracker
Spending-tracker is a prototype web-application to keep track of one's personal expenses and incomes. This is a term project for COMP 3020.

# Usage
All the features in the application work as intended except the settings page. The settings page contains the options as it would have in a complete application but at this momemnt we refrained from making it work in order to focus more on designing the interface using the design principles from class. 

All the codes for the web page are included in the index.html file. To use the application open the index.html file
